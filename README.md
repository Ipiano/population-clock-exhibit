# Population Clock

A small app built for the Children's Museum of Minnesota Ag Lab to showcase the world's population for young inquisiting minds.

# Initial Requirements

* Display the world population clock
* Will run on a screen
* Should not be interactable
* Will just be a thin, wide screen; only the population on it - 24"x ~6"
* https://www.census.gov/popclock/
* Want to keep it relatively up to date with real world
    * Probably can't just embed the clock from the site - more data than we want
    * Something like a 7-segment display would be good
    * Could run off a RPi-0 or something
